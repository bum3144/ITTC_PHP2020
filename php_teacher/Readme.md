# Don't Repeat Yourself

The DRY Principle is one of the tenets or key concepts of programing. DRY (D-R-Y) stands for Don't Repeat Yourself. If you see yourself repeating code in the same place, for example, writing the same string over and over again, it's a good sign you can improve your programming using DRY programming techniques.
