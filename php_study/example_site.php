				<p>While the Sandiganbayan acquitted former Senator Bong Revilla, it never said he is innocent, a former Supreme Court (SC) spokesperson said Tuesday.

				Speaking to CNN Philippines' The Source, former SC spokesperson Theodore Te said the anti-graft court only said there was not enough evidence to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

				Te explained that the Rules of Court provides for two forms of acquittal – one where the court finds that there is absolutely no proof beyond reasonable doubt and another where the court says the prosecution failed to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt.</p>
